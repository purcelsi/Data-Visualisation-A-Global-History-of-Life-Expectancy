# Data-Visualisation-A-Global-History-of-Life-Expectancy

This project aims to address the subject of global life expectancy â€“ is it improving, and if so, is this improvement consistent across countries? Which countries have fared the best or worst historically and where do they stand today? What are the factors that influence life expectancy such that we might utilise this knowledge to improve it?
To address these questions, the project utilises data from the World Health Organisation and a myriad of other open-source health related databases. 
In an aim to contextualise the discussion of global life expectancy, a variety of other demographic factors and socio-economic factors were retrieved. All visualisations were aided by Tableau, ggplot2 in R Studio as well as graphic design tools using Canva, Powerpoint and Adobe Photoshop.


This project will be divided into two sections and their outputs will output from this project will proceed as follows:

1)	Final Report (Narrative and Visualisation Methodology) 

This contains an ordered compilation of insights derived from the exploratory and visual analysis, a discussion into their implications, followed by a summarization of key findings through the illustration of a concluding infographic. 
The report alson outlines the methods for retrieving, processing and visualising the data, as well as an explanation on for the visual or design choices for conveying the data.. 


2)	Interactive Data Visualisation Tableau Storyboard: a dashboard published to Tableau Server, which enables the user to engage with the visualisations that furnish the insights for the Narrative Report.

Features of this interactive dashboard include interactive charts with filtering capabilities on year and country as well as animations. In this way users can explore or delve deeper into the underlying datasets to further enhance their understanding. In addition, this facilitates a sense of engagement and ownership of the insights, as users are invited to interact and study these visualisations further.
